# Gcovr Action

Generate code coverage reports for a C++ project on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) using [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/).

## Features

- Generate code coverage reports using [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/).
- Generate and send reports in [Coveralls API](https://docs.coveralls.io/api-introduction) format.
- Auto detect and install required dependencies.
- Support coverage report on [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [LLVM Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).
- Support files exclusion and fail if coverage is below a specific thresold.

## Usage

For more information, see [action.yml](./action.yml) and [GitHub Actions guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

### Inputs

| Name | Value Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | Path | Root directory of your source files. Defaults to current directory. File names are reported relative to this directory. |
| `gcov-executable` | Executable name with optional arguments | Use a particular [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) executable. Must match the compiler you are using, e.g. `llvm-cov gcov` for [LLVM Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/). See [this](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/guide/compiling.html#choosing-the-right-gcov-executable). |
| `excludes` | One or more regular expression | Exclude source files that match these filters. |
| `fail-under-line` | 0 - 100 | Fail if the total line coverage is less than this value. |
| `xml-out` | Path | Output file of the generated XML coverage report. |
| `coveralls-out` | Path | Output file of the generated [Coveralls API](https://docs.coveralls.io/api-introduction) coverage report. |
| `coveralls-send` | `true` or `false` | Send the generated Coveralls API coverage report to it's endpoint. Defaults to `false`. |
| `github-token` | Token | [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) of your project. Defaults to [`github.token`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication). Required for sending Coveralls API coverage report successfully. |

> Note: All inputs are optional.
